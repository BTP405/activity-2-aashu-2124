Consider the following code blocks which generate the same output.

i). (7 points) Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.
(ANSWER)
Approach 1:
This one defines a funtion doubleL(n), here an integer n is taken as a input, than a loop is created that iterates from 0 to n-1, this loop will take each of its current instances and multiply it by 2 and the result will be appened at the end. Finally, a list of all the updated instances will be provided.

Approach 2:
Heres a list of comprehensions that will be used to create a list of double value from 0 to 4, since the range function eliminates the last element. Doubling each value 'n' and creating a new list with these doubled values. Then it iterates over this list and prints each element followed by a colon and space.

Approach 3
Here we made use of generator function called doubleG(n), that will take aninteger 'n' as an input. In this function it iterates over a range(0 to (n-1)), these instance will than be similarly doubled instead of being returned directly.
The main block will than call the function, with 5 as an argument, which will be taken by the function as a parameter that will set the value of n.

OUTPUT FOR ALL OF THE APPROACHES WILL BE: 
0 : 2 : 4 : 6 : 8 :

ii. (3 points) What type of function is doubleG(n)? What is the advantage of using such a function?
(ANSWER)
   1. Efficient Memory Usage: Values are created instantaneoulsy, in other words they are created on the fuly, this saves a lot of memory in comparison to storing an entire sequence in memory at once.
   2. infinite sequences:
   This funcion can produce and infinite number of sequences without running into memory issues, as the value genreated are regualted with respect to its need.
